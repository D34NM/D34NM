## Who am I?

I'm a type of person that enjoys tackling a challange and trying to understand what makes things tick. Spending a lot of time learning about different aspects of software development is something that is daily occurance for me. One of the big motivations for me is the knowledge sharing. The software craftsmanship is not, in my opinion, something that can be achived by oneself. Learning from the people around you and sharing that knowledge is a great way to make a great team.
